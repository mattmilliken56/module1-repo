## Description

I took on this endeavor to help update and clean up some of the old design and make it more user friendly.

Majority of the CSS files were duplicated that they had the same features listed for different classes and IDS, I consolidated these so the code would not be so long but still function the same.

The link to view "Search Engine Optomization" was broken, this has been repaired so the website will now function correctly.

There was no title for the page. I have updated it with "Welcome to Horison" and added in a thumbnail photo to make it more attractive to users

I hope that these updates help you and your company!
